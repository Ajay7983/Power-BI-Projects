# Pizza Sales Analysis - Power BI Project

## Overview  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using **Power BI**. The goal is to extract actionable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and store performance to aid in strategic decision-making.

## Key Objectives  
- Identify top-performing pizzas and categories based on sales and revenue.  
- Analyze customer purchase patterns to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.  
- Evaluate sales performance across various time periods and locations.  
- Highlight key performance metrics (KPIs) such as revenue, profit margins, and average order value.

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and report creation.  
- **Excel/CSV**: Data source for sales records.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating custom measures and calculated columns.

## Features of the Dashboard  
1. **Sales Summary**:  
   - Total Revenue, Units Sold, Profit Margin, and Average Order Value.  
   - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth metrics.

2. **Product Analysis**:  
   - Best-selling pizzas by revenue and units sold.  
   - Profitability by pizza size and type (e.g., Classic, Gourmet).

3. **Customer Insights**:  
   - Order frequency and average spend per customer.  
   - Peak order hours and days for optimized staffing and marketing.

4. **Time-Based Trends**:  
   - Seasonal and monthly sales trends.  
   - Weekly and daily breakdown of sales.

## Dataset  
The dataset includes the following fields:  
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.  
- **Date**: The date and time of the order.  
- **Pizza Name**: The specific pizza ordered.  
- **Category**: Pizza category (e.g., Veggie, Meat, Gourmet).  
- **Size**: Pizza size (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).  
- **Price**: Unit price of the pizza.  
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold in the transaction.  

## Steps to Recreate the Project  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Import the pizza sales dataset into Power BI.  
   - Perform necessary data cleaning, such as handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.

2. **Data Modeling**:  
   - Create relationships between tables, if applicable (e.g., Date table, Product table).  
   - Develop calculated columns and measures using DAX for KPIs like Total Revenue and Profit Margin.

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Build interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.  
   - Use slicers and filters for dynamic user interaction (e.g., filtering by date, store, or pizza type).

4. **Insights Generation**:  
   - Identify actionable insights from the visualizations.  
   - Highlight patterns and trends in the dashboard to aid decision-making.

## Challenges Faced  
- Handling missing or inconsistent data in the sales records.  
- Designing an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard layout.

## Outcomes  
- Clear insights into top-performing products and underperforming categories.  
- Improved decision-making on inventory management and marketing strategies.  
- Enhanced understanding of customer behavior to increase customer satisfaction.
